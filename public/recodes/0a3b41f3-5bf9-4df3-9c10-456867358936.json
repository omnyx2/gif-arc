Object는 GIF이미지 재생 동안 존재하는 모든 오브젝트 이다.\n    1. 이때 오브젝트는 다음과 같이 2종류가 있다.\n        1. explicit 오브젝트: 물리량이 정확히 존재하는 객체로 정의한다.\n        2. implicit 오브젝트: explicit 물체가 모여 비유적인 객체가 존재한다. (사람들로 도형을 만들거나 하는 등)\n2. 아날로지 A는 GIF내 단일 a를 모두 모은 Space 이다.\n    1. 아날로지는 다음과 같이 3종류와 하나 더 얹어진 아날로지로 구성한다.\n        1. clear 아날로지(cla): 아날로지 중 상호작용에 관여되는 객체 explicit오브젝트이며 지정과 목표, 정확한 파라메터가 요구된다. (중력에 의해 공이 10m 등, 도형이 나선형으로 회전 하고 있다)\n        2. ambiguous 아날로지(aba): 아날로지 중 상호작용에 작용되는 객체가 implicit오브젝트이며 목표가 지정되지 않을 수 있고 파라메타는 간접적이다. (사람이 모여 팩맨을 만들고, 팩맨은 돈을 먹으로 다닌다)\n        3. Contrain 아날로지(coa): 상호작용중 제약으로 동작하는 아날로지이다. 객체는 explicit implicit을 전부 포함할수 있다. ( 그림상의 모든 물체는 벽을 넘어갈수 없다)\n        4. poeatic 아날로지(poa): 위의 세 아날로지를 바탕으로 생성된 비유적 표현의 아날로지이다.\n3. T는 GIF의 전체 재생 시간을 의미하며\n    1. T는 맥락(장면) 바뀌는 구간들인 $T={T_1,T_2,T_3,..., T_n}$로 나뉜다. ($T_i$: 사람들이 야구를 보는 장면, $T_{i+1}$: 야구 투수가 공을쳐서 날아간 장면)\n    2. $\\sum{}T_i$는 전체 재생 시간 보다 같거나 길다. 이는 장면전환에 발생하는 시간에 의해서 그렇게 된다.\n4. N은 보조인자로 큰 고려대상은 아니다. 예) GIF가 자체가 가지는 노이즈로 이는 가우스 노이즈의 역함수로 정의한다.\n비유에 대한 정의\nGIF에 대한 정의가 완료되고 다음은 이를 보았을 때 비유를 정의한다; M. 비유는 전체적인 상황에 대한 비유, 객체에 대한 비유(implicit 오브젝트), 상호작용에 대한 비유가 존재한다. 비유는 여러 상황을 하나로 묶는데 동작할 수 있다. 따라서 아래와 같이 GIF 를 정의 하는 내부요소에 대해 비유는 관측되며, 이러한 관측 된 비유는 너무 완전히 같지 않고 너무 완전히 다르지 않은 영역에서 동일한 비유가 생성될 수 있다.\n$p_i(Object,A,T_i,N|m_i)$ ~ $M_i$\n$p_j(Object,A,T_j,N|m_j)$ ~ $M_j$\n$0.8 > D_{KL}(M_i||M_j) > 0.5, \\ M_i = M_j$\nGIF를 ARC 하는 작업 정의\n이러한 GIF를 ARC 하기 위해 작업을 고려하였을 때, GIF에서 바로 아크로 가는 작업은 다중 아날로지에서 하나의 단일 아날로지로 가는 동시에 시간에 대해 있던 정보가 유실됨으로 많은 단계를 건너 띄는 것처럼 보임. 따라서 기존의 압축절차를 단계별로 세분화하고 이를 바탕으로 점진적으로 정보를 떨어 뜨리는 과정으로 시도하고 있음."
