The transformation rule is:\n\n• Horizontally mirror (flip top row with bottom row, etc.).  \n• Then switch (swap) color 1 with color 9 in the resulting grid.\n\nThere are three training (input → output) examples and one test (input → output) example. Afterward, you will see a short “analogy” (description) and a solution program using Michael Hodel’s DSL.\n\n────────────────────────────────────────────────────────\n1) TRAINING EXAMPLES\n────────────────────────────────────────────────────────\n\nTRAIN #1  \nInput (5×5):\n0 0 0 0 1  \n0 0 1 0 0  \n0 1 0 1 0  \n1 0 0 0 0  \n0 0 0 0 0  \n\nOutput (5×5):\n0 0 0 0 0  \n9 0 0 0 0  \n0 9 0 9 0  \n0 0 9 0 0  \n0 0 0 0 9  \n\n────────────────────────────────────────────────────────\n\nTRAIN #2  \nInput (5×5):\n2 0 0 0 1  \n1 1 0 0 0  \n2 0 1 0 1  \n0 0 1 1 1  \n0 0 0 0 1  \n\nHorizontally mirrored, then switching 1 ↔ 9 yields:\n\nOutput (5×5):\n0 0 0 0 9  \n0 0 9 9 9  \n2 0 9 0 9  \n9 9 0 0 0  \n2 0 0 0 9  \n\n────────────────────────────────────────────────────────\n\nTRAIN #3  \nInput (5×5):\n0 1 0 1 1  \n0 0 0 0 0  \n1 0 2 2 2  \n0 2 0 1 0  \n1 0 0 2 0  \n\nAfter the same transformation (horizontal mirror + swap 1→9):\n\nOutput (5×5):\n9 0 0 2 0  \n0 2 0 9 0  \n9 0 2 2 2  \n0 0 0 0 0  \n0 9 0 9 9  \n\n────────────────────────────────────────────────────────\n2) TEST EXAMPLE\n────────────────────────────────────────────────────────\n\nTEST  \nInput (5×5):\n0 0 1 1 1  \n0 2 0 0 1  \n0 2 1 0 2  \n0 0 0 0 0  \n1 0 0 2 1  \n\nApply the same rule (horizontal mirror + swap 1→9), the result is:\n\nOutput (5×5):\n9 0 0 2 9  \n0 0 0 0 0  \n0 2 9 0 2  \n0 2 0 0 9  \n0 0 9 9 9  \n\n────────────────────────────────────────────────────────\n3) ANALOGY / EXPLANATION\n────────────────────────────────────────────────────────\n\nObserving the examples, the logic is:\n1. Horizontally mirror the entire grid (top row becomes bottom, second row becomes second-to-last, etc.).  \n2. Convert “1” cells to “9.” (Equivalent to switch(grid, 1, 9). Since no “9” appears in most inputs, it effectively turns 1 into 9. If “9” did appear, it would also turn 9 into 1.)\n\nThus, each output is simply hmirror(input) followed by switch(...,1,9).\n\n────────────────────────────────────────────────────────\n4) PROGRAM USING HODEL’S DSL\n────────────────────────────────────────────────────────\n\nBelow is a concise solution written with the provided DSL definitions. It uses hmirror for horizontal flip and switch for color swapping:\n\n━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━\nfrom arc_types import *\n\ndef solve(grid: Grid) -> Grid:\n    # 1) Mirror the grid horizontally\n    mirrored = hmirror(grid)\n    # 2) Swap color 1 with color 9\n    result = switch(mirrored, 1, 9)\n    return result\n━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━\n\nIn an actual ARC solver, you would apply solve(...) to each input grid to produce the matching output."
